aimz is a Python library for scalable probabilistic impact modeling, enabling assessment of intervention effects on outcomes with a streamlined interface for fitting, sampling, prediction, and effect estimationâ€”minimal boilerplate, accelerated execution, and powered by `NumPyro <https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/>`_, `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `Xarray <https://xarray.dev/>`_, and `Zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
It features:

* Intuitive API combining the ease of use from ML frameworks with the flexibility of probabilistic modeling.
* Accelerated computation via parallelism and distributed data.
* Support for interventional causal inference for counterfactuals and causal effects.
* MLflow integration for experiment tracking and model management.
