**aimz** is a Python library for flexible and scalable probabilistic impact modeling to assess the effects of interventions on outcomes of interest.
Designed to work with user-defined models with probabilistic primitives, the library builds on `NumPyro <https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/>`_, `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `Xarray <https://xarray.dev/>`_, and `Zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to enable efficient inference workflows.

Features
--------

- An intuitive API that combines ease of use from ML frameworks with the flexibility of probabilistic modeling.
- Scalable computation via parallelism and distributed data processingâ€”no manual orchestration required.
- Variational inference as the primary inference engine, supporting custom optimization strategies and results.
- Support for interventional causal inference for modeling counterfactuals and causal relations.
- MLflow integration for experiment tracking and model management.

Workflow
--------

1. Outline the model, considering the data generating process, latent variables, and causal relationships, if any.
2. Translate the model into a **kernel** (i.e., a function) using NumPyro and JAX.
3. Integrate the kernel into the provided API to train the model and perform inference.
